**_menzaar_** represents the on target part of a software logical analyzer optimized for debugging embedded systems. **_menzaar_** runs on target with the embedded system. Through simple APIs, embedded developers can assert "software" signals, which are displayed on a host PC through the GUI based application **_marsad_**.

Both **_menzaar_** and **_marsad_** provide embedded developers with means of analyzing temporal behavior of embedded software, like measuring time difference between different system events, calculating the duration of a specific procedure, or analyzing threading behavior.

**_menzaar_** is designed to impose minimum overhead on the system being analyzed, for both memory and performance.
